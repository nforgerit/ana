# Ana

Simple anagram checker for the command line.

It simply lowercases the two given strings, splits up both 
strings into lists of chars, sorts both lists and compares
them for equality. Though some edge cases are tested for, it
might fail terribly for others.

You might not want to use it to keep your airplane up in 
the air.
