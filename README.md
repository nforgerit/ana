# Ana

Simple anagram checker for the command line.

## Functionality
It simply lowercases the two given strings, splits up both 
strings into lists of chars, sorts both lists and compares
them for equality. Though some edge cases are tested for, it
might fail terribly for others.

## Testing
The script uses pytest which is not distributed with this
script so you'll need to install it in your local env.

## Disclaimer
You might not want to use it to keep your airplane up in 
the air.
